The diagram above shows a simplified view of the short-range logistics industry and its key participants. While TruckIT caters primarily to **haulers**, understanding relationships between our customers and _their_ customers helps us to better serve their needs and understand their activity on the platform.

- **Haulers: **The typical TruckIT customer is a short-range trucker known as a hauler. Haulers transport material between a material _supplier _and material _purchaser _on the purchaser's behalf. The purchaser is often, but not always, a contractor. Prime haulers receive work either directly via project bids, or indirectly through brokers. Their fleets are typically large, but they will delegate to _Sub Haulers _as a way to mitigate insufficient capacity. _Sub Haulers _typically receive their work through the prime hauler, but may transport material for multiple primes. 

  <Info>
    Sub-haulers are often referred to by different names in different regions. You may hear the terms _'Lease Drivers', 'Hired-Ons', 'Third-Parties' _and the like; these all mean the same thing.

- **Contractor: **The hauler's typical customer is a contractor, who manages the acquisition of aggregate materials (dirt, stone, etc) for construction projects. This is the main, but not exclusive, type of material purchaser. Contractors may work with _several _haulers and/or_freight brokers _ on large projects. Complicating the matter, they also may own and operate their own fleet of vehicles, though this is less common. Contractors _typically_ order materials from suppliers like pits and quarries, and separately order transport services from hauling companies, but this is also a simplified view. For example, some hauling companies are also material _suppliers_ or _producers._
