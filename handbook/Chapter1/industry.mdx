The diagram above shows a simplified view of the short-range logistics industry and its key participants. While TruckIT caters primarily to **haulers**, understanding relationships between our customers and _their_ customers helps us to better serve their needs and understand their activity on the platform.

  <Accordion title="Hauler" icon="sparkles">
    - The typical TruckIT customer is a short-range trucker known as a hauler. Haulers transport material between a _material supplier_ and _material purchaser_ on the purchaser's behalf. The purchaser is often, but not always, a contractor. Prime haulers receive work either directly via project bids, or indirectly through brokers. Their fleets are typically large, but they will delegate to _Sub Haulers_ as a way to mitigate insufficient capacity. Sub Haulers _typically _receive their work through the prime hauler, but may transport material for multiple primes.

      <Info>
        Sub-haulers are often referred to by different names in different regions. You may hear the terms _'Lease Drivers',_ _'Hired-Ons'_, _'Third-Parties' _and the like; these all mean the same thing.

  <Accordion title="Contractor" icon="sparkles">
    The hauler's typical customer is a contractor, who manages the acquisition of aggregate materials (dirt, stone, etc) for construction projects. This is the main, but not exclusive, type of material purchaser. Contractors may work with_several_  haulers and/or_freight brokers _ on large projects. Complicating the matter, they also may own and operate their own fleet of vehicles, though this is less common. Contractors _typically_ order materials from suppliers like pits and quarries, and separately order transport services from hauling companies, but this is also a simplified view. For example, some hauling companies are also material _suppliers_ or _producers._
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Material Supplier" icon="sparkles">
    These companies either directly provide raw material, produce refined goods from raw materials, or act as middle-men between raw material providers and their purchasers. They may employ their own fleet and manage delivery themselves, or they may require the customer to manage transport.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Broker" icon="sparkles">
    Freight _brokers_ typically <u>do not </u>own and operate their own fleet; they leverage their existing relationships with large sets of hauling companies to provide tranport services. Contractors use brokers primarily when it is more _efficient_ than <u>managing relationships with haulers directly</u>. Brokers assume risk and liability, maintain logistics networks, manage financing (see: factoring), and are typically able to offer volume-based discounts.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Factoring Companies" icon="sparkles">
    -  Factoring companies facilitate liquidity; Contractors typically operate on 30 or 60 day payment cycles, while haulers need immediate access to funds. Factoring companies enable this access by purchasing a hauler's _outstanding receivables_ for a small fee. This improves the hauler's cash flow and allows them to take on additional work.
